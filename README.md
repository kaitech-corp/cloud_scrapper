The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of our application. It will contain the FastAPI app instance and the API endpoint definitions.

2. `scrape.py`: This file will contain the `Scrape` class that will handle the scraping of the webpages.

3. `gpt.py`: This file will contain the `GPT` class that will handle the generation of tags using the ChatGPT API.

4. `storage.py`: This file will contain the `Storage` class that will handle the storage of the JSON object in the cloud storage bucket.

5. `utils.py`: This file will contain utility functions such as `validate_url` for URL validation and `create_json` for creating the JSON object.

6. `test_main.py`: This file will contain the test cases for our application.

7. `Dockerfile`: This file will contain the instructions to build the Docker image for our application.

8. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that our application needs.

9. `README.md`: This file will contain the documentation on how to use the API endpoint and its dependencies.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`main.py`
